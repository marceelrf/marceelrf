## About me

I'm a brazilian medical physicist with master in Biotechnology and currently a PhD candidate (Biotechnology) at São Paulo State University ([UNESP](https://unesp.br/)). On April 2022 I joined the Witek Lab at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) as a visiting schoolar. 

🔭 I’m currently working on the development of tools for bone biomaterials analysis, focusing on alternative methods to animal testing.  

:eyes: I have interest in biological databases, bioinfomatics analysis, data science, machine learning and new technologies as 3D bioprinting and organ-on-a-chip.
